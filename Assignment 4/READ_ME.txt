Ann Kent Assignment 4


I refenced my code from assignemtn 2 a lot, using pretty much the same design.

I'm going to us string comp to compare the words.

if it =0 thats a win
else it will loop until out of turns

TO DO:

Pick word[x]
guess word[x]
check guess with answer [x]
Tell player if the got the word or[x]
if they ran out of guesses[x]
change list of valid letters?[]

Ask in class, does it need to be a word, or just one letter? if it's a word, how cab i change the list ogf valid letters?
